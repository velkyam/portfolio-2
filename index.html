                <h2>Ponder: Social Media</h2>
                <p> Ponder is a randomized social forum, whereby the user is able to 'Go Fish' from a pool of thoughts
                    collected from all around the world, or post a thought themselves. The user has the option to create
                    an account and post their thoughts, or 'Ponders,' under their username, but they can also elect to
                    post anonymously. No account is necessary to use Ponder--anyone can join the conversation. However,
                    only users with an account will be able to see a history of all their posts, and users posting
                    anonymously will have a profanity filter applied to help curb toxicity.

                <p> The goal of this project was to generate a webpage with information about my team. Each team member
                    entered into the application has its own employee card with name, id, role, email, and (github,
                    school, or office number), as well as appropriate icon. The application was built through test
                    driven development and object oriented programming. <a

                <h2>Weather Application</h2>
                <p> The goal of this project was to create a weather web application. The website was build to provide
                    current weather and near future weather forecast at any user input city. The app provides icon,
                    temperature, wind, and humidity for today and 5 other days. Furthermore, it stores user input cities
                    in local storage to make cities quickly accessible even if the site closes. <a

                <h2>Day Planner</h2>
                <p> The goal of this project was to develop a day planner site for an emplyee during regular working
                    hours. The application can store user's events in and color coordinates them based on the current
                    time. Present time slot is colored in red, past in gray, and future in green. The planner stores
                    data in local storage, therefore stored events will appear even after closing. Each even has
                    corresponding save button with a checkmark on it. <a
